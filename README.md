# project-phoenix

A self-study project using rust-lang. This project will roughly follow [this repo](https://github.com/cnp0/coding-interview-university).

# About

Maintaining sharp :crossed_swords: and learning rust along the way. This is an open contribution to the self-learning community. Pull requests are welcome!

# Topics

**Note**: this list attempts to consolidate the `study-program`'s readme. Some topics might be merged or broken up over time. 

**Disclaimer**: The contents of this project are produced using my understanding of each topic at the time of contributing the material. **If any of this information is incorrect, misleading, or incomplete, please feel free to submit a correction/suggestion in the form of an issue or a pull request.**
