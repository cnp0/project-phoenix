# project-phoenix

A self-study project using rust-lang. This project will roughly follow [this repo](https://github.com/cnp0/coding-interview-university).

# About

Maintaining sharp :crossed_swords: and learning rust along the way. This is an open contribution to the self-learning community. Pull requests are welcome!
