# project-phoenix

A self-study project using rust-lang. This project will roughly follow [this repo](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university).

# About

The goal of this project is to reinforce a lot of the knowledge and skills I've gained over the years with a refresh on the fundamentals of and some advanced topics for computer science.
